## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

I love the idea that learning is a journey and a process. I tend to be outcome oriented, which can get in the way of a growth mindset. That being said, I always strive to have an open mind and be ready to unlearn and relearn, as needed.

The best way to grow in your knowledge of something is to teach others! YES YES YES.  

I love working in multiple short sessions and I currently use a tomato timer to help with that approach. I don’t always use it but I’m always glad when I do, especially for tasks that can’t be completed in one sitting (i.e. longer than 30ish minutes).

As a side note, I was pretty put off that the only successful people mentioned in the article are rich white men. I’d love to hear about habits from a more representative group of super-learners.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

String - A collection of characters. Must be contained within "" or ''.
Number - Any numerical value, including positive, negative and decimal values, which are referred to as floats.
Boolean - Values of either True or false, used for logic within a program.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

console.log("Hello World!");

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

Comments can be indicated with "//" or contained within "/*.... */".  

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

A variable is a flexible container for any type of data.

"A variable is like a box. You can only put one thing in the box at a time. If you want to put something different in the box, you have to take the other thing out."

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

I like to find photos on unsplash.com. Some variables the site probably uses include:
* username - string (this one is pretty obvious)
* tags - string (these are attached to images to allow for quick sorting)
* likeCount - number (my user profile includes a count of the total number of images that I "like")


7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

Concatenation is the joining or combining of multiple strings. You can concatenate non-strings because JS will automatically convert all data to a string using _type coercion_.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?

The homepage of unsplash.com features a photo of the day, which is presented using the format "Photo of the Day by Picture Taker". This sentence is probably concatenated.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

How often are typos the cause of errors? So far, problems created by typos have been the trickiest to sort out, because typos in terminal can create problems that are much harder to iron than simply fixing an incorrect character.
