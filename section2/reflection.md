## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

_I tend resist asking questions until I've been stuck for too long. Like many, I've had experiences that left me feeling like having questions or needing help is a weakness. I'm grateful for Turing's positive and supportive culture. :)_

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

_My first reaction was to feel bad for not remembering some of those details but I soon used it as an opportunity to try. I eventually had to look up a few things but it felt good to push myself to remember on my own and that made looking things up feel less disappointing._

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

_A conditional statement is one that checks the status of specific parameter before proceeding. In daily life, this could include "if I am hungry, I eat food." When I'm playing D&D with my friends on roll20.com, the dashboard will show my friends' names and icons but only IF they are logged in to the site._

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

_Logical operators (&& and ||) allow for multiple conditions in an if statement. An if statement will check each condition sequentially and will proceed with the code in the brackets as soon as it reads any data that satisfies the condition. Otherwise, it will skip all of the code contain with the {} of the if statement._

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

_I think that logical operators would also be the best way to check that 2 or 1 of 2 conditions are met prior to running the code block._

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

_I'm curious to learn more about being efficient with my conditionals. It seems like this could be a way for code to get bogged down with numerous lines of inefficient code._
