## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

"SMART goals" is a concept that I could benefit from greatly. I usually create unrealistic expectations of myself by setting improbable goals.  

Establishing habits can help me adopt a mindset of learning as a process rather than a series of tasks to complete.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

I am usually pretty good at constructive criticism of my work and genuinely believe it will help me improve.

Sometimes I conflate normal predictable behaviors with personal failure. I crave the feeling of being good at things and thus sometimes have trouble when I'm learning something new.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

Codeacademy keeps track of every day that I do coding exercises and allows me to see the dates that I worked. These dates are probably stored in an array.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
An Array method is one of many tools that is built in to array objects that allow for the location and manipulation of data within the array.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

Loops are used to repeat portions of code multiple times. Loops are well suited for working with arrays because arrays contain a collection of related data, which often need to be processed in similar ways. An example of a loop that wouldn't require an array would be one that repeats a prompt for input until the user follows the formatting guidelines.  

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

Loops are a way of programming a computer to do the same job lots of times in a row. Let's say you had a robot that cooked pancakes and it needed to flip every pancake 5 times to make sure it was cooked enough. You could tell the robot each time you wanted the pancake to be flipped, or you could create a loop that told the robot "flip every pancake 5 times."

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

I noticed in the MDN documentation a reference to array-like objects, which contained a multiple data records in each element, similar to a hash:

_"var myFish = {0:'angel', 1:'clown', 2:'mandarin', 3:'sturgeon', length: 4};"_

Is a hash an array-like object?
