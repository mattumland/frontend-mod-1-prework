## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique  

I've been using the Pomodoro technique for years on and off. Since starting MOD 0, I've made a point of using it more and I can tell that I'm better at staying focused.  

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?  

In general, I need to practice setting intentions and creating SMART goals. The work I did in section 4 didn't align very well with the timer, which meant that I ended up taking breaks in between sections. While I assumed this would upset my flow, it didn't have any negative impact on my work.   

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?

An object is a collection of key-values, which are pairs of data. Each value has an associated key, and these two things are stored together. This is similar to an Array expect an array is best suited for data that have the same type whereas an Object can hold multiple data types. In an Array, each item has a numerical index, which is used to access the stored data. In an Object, the data is indexed using the keys.  

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.  

  * List of all of the students in class
  * _Array because this only contains strings_
  * List of states and their capitals
  * _Object because it contains two types of data that need to be stored together (state and capital)._
  * List of things to pack for vacation
  * _Object because it is likely you will need to bring multiples of each item. An object could contain both the item and the number that needs to be packed._
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
  * _Array because this only contains strings_
  * List of student names and their cohort
  * _Object because it contains two types of data that need to be stored together (name and cohort)._
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
  * _Object because it contains two types of data that need to be stored together (ingredient and amount)._
  * All my favorite restaurants
  * _Array because this only contains strings_  

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?  

Youtube probably uses an Object for userAccounts. Here are some examples of data userAccounts might contain
 * userName: MattUmland
 * likedVids: _array of links to liked videos_
 * watchLater: _array of links to videos in the 'watch later' playlist_
 * uploads: _array of links to videos uploaded by the user_
 * userImage: _location of a saved image to display on the users profile_

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?

At this point, the content seems fairly clear (_I think_) but I'm still struggling to internalize the syntax. I often forget what is supposed to be camelCase and what is supposed to be Pascal.
